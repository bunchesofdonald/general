## Experience

### Principal Software Engineer, O'Reilly Media
Portland, OR — November 2012 to Present

I started with Safari Books Online in late 2012 as a software engineer, but was
quickly promoted to Senior and then Principal.

For the first few years I was doing full-stack development, working with
finance APIs and building out user-facing features. But for the past few years
I've been focused on breaking down our monolith, microservice architecture and
developer experience.

**Accomplishments**

- Integral in launching several large features to the main site.
- Created JWT-based authentication system and all of the tooling for our Python
  services to use it.
- Created internal tools that reduced the turn-around time for building and
  releasing microservices to production from months to weeks, and even a single
  day in some cases.
- Created unit-testing tools to keep APIs and documentation in sync.

### Developer III, The Nerdery
Minneapolis, MN — March 2012 to October 2013

I lead over a dozen projects and contributed to 70+ different projects, as a
team member, mentor and consultant. My primary focus was Python, specializing
in Django.

**Accomplishments**

- Lead developer on a large project with tight deadlines and a demanding
  client. I received recognition from the COO for my extraordinary efforts.
- Became the go to person for several developers to assist them with solving
  problems in Python, Javascript and Git.
- Profiled a client’s Django admin and was able to increase the performance of
  their slowest pages from 20+ seconds to 2 seconds.
- Received a shout-out from the resource team for being able to ‘crush’
  whatever they’ve given me.
- Founding member of the Python committee and was instrumental in forming
  python standards and documentation.


### Software Engineer, National Realty Systems
Cicero, IN — January 2002 to March 2012

I was directly involved in the creation of the company as well as being the
sole creator of their flagship product ZODAS, an online document management
system. Currently the system is used by over 60 companies nationwide.

**Accomplishments**

- Designed and developed, in Perl, the front-end web application.
- Designed back-end database schema, utilizing at different points, both MySQL
  and later PostgreSQL
- Created back-end image parser, in C# and Perl, to convert incoming TIFFs into
  multiple PDFʼs based on barcodes included in the TIFF.
